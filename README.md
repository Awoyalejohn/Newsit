## User Experience

I made user stories to plan and develop the functionality of the website. Each user story was separated into Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, and Won’t Have categories to help determine what was most important to focus on or leave out when building the website.

## Design
### Colour Scheme
The website colours used are black, white and blue colours that contrast well with each other. I verified this using Adobe color.
![Colour contrast image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Awoyalejohn/TD/main/static/images/color-contrast.png)

-   The navbar uses a white background with black text
-   The main website background used the blue colour
-   The card items are white and their contrast with blue makes for a satisfying look
-   Buttons are blue or black depending on their function. Blue usually edit buttons and black for everything else.
-   Footer is white
### Typography
The website uses Helvetica Neue as the main font-family and it is supplied by Bootstrap default.
### Wireframes
Wireframes were made with Figma to get a better idea on how things would look layout-wise on the website. The website is meant to look similar to Reddit, as it is a news posting website based on Reddit there are cards with post content inside them just like Reddit.
![wireframe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Awoyalejohn/TD/main/static/images/wireframe.png)
## Agile
The project features on GitHub was used to create a Kanban board that lists all of the user stories. Each user story has task that the user might be able to do on the website once the functionality has been added. All the must have user stories have been completed and the some of the user stories that are should have and could have will get implemented future when there is more time.

## Bugs
### Fixed
- Django Generic list view does a lot things that is not clear and raised errors when a page with a slug URL was clicked on. Switching to a normal view fixed the issue.

### Remaining found Bugs
- Posts and comments aren’t ordered by most recernt even though the meta class is set to order by created on date

- Likes and Comments don't show on homepage

- Trying to edit or delete comments on profile pages causes errors

## Deployment
### Development

1.  Create Repo
    
2.  Clone Repo
    
3.  Install python
    
4.  Install Django and the supporting libraries
    
    ```bash
    pip3 install django gunicorn
    pip3 install dj_database_url psycopg2
    pip3 install dj3-cloudinary-storage
    
    ```
    
5.  Create requirements file for Heroku
    
    ```bash
    pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
    
    ```
    
6.  like this
    
    ```bash
    asgiref==3.5.2
    backports.zoneinfo==0.2.1
    cloudinary==1.29.0
    dj-database-url==0.5.0
    dj3-cloudinary-storage==0.0.6
    Django==4.0.4
    django-allauth==0.50.0
    django-autoslug==1.9.8
    django-crispy-forms==1.14.0
    django-summernote==0.8.20.0
    gunicorn==20.1.0
    oauthlib==3.2.0
    psycopg2==2.9.3
    PyJWT==2.4.0
    python3-openid==3.2.0
    requests-oauthlib==1.3.1
    sqlparse==0.4.2
    
    ```
    
7.  Create a new Django Project
    
    ```bash
    django-admin startproject <projectName>
    
    ```
    
8.  Create a new Django app
    
    ```bash
    python3 manage.py startapp <appName>
    
    ```
    
9.  Then add the new app to settings.py file
    
    ```bash
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        'django.contrib.admin',
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        'django.contrib.sessions',
        'django.contrib.messages',
        'django.contrib.staticfiles',
        'newapp', #new goes here
    ]
    
    ```
    
10.  Now you need to migrate changes
    
    ```bash
    python3 manage.py migrate
    
    ```
    
11.  then run the project to make sure everything is working okay
    
    ```bash
    python3 manage.py runserver
    
    ```
    
12.  Then you sign up or login into Heroku to create the app
    
13.  Create a new app on Heroku by clicking the new app button
    
14.  Go to the resources tab
    
15.  Search for ‘Heroku Postgres’
    
16.  Click the submit order form button
    
17.  Go to the settings tab
    
18.  Click on the reveal Config Vars button
    
19.  Copy the Postgres URL value to the right of the Database_url key
    
20.  Go back to the Django project on the code editor
    
21.  Create an env.py file in the same directory as your manage.py file.
    
22.  Add in these environment variables for the database and secret key inside the env.py file.
    
23.  Now copy the name value of your secret key and paste it into config vars on Heroku then click add.
    
24.  Go to the settings.py file
    
25.  Add these imports at the top of the settings.py file.
    
    ```python
    from pathlib import Path
    import os
    import dj_database_url
    if os.path.isfile('env.py'):
        import env
    
    ```
    
26.  Then go to the insecure SECRET-KEY in settings.py and change its value to target the secret key in the env.py file instead.
    
27.  Then go down to the database section in settings.py. Comments out the default DATABASES python dictionary with `ctrl +/` then add your own database link to the env.py file.
    
28.  Now you need to migrate changes again
    
    ```bash
    python3 manage.py migrate
    
    ```
    
29.  You can go back to Heroku app now and click the resources tab
    
30.  Then click on the Heroku Postgres add-on to check that the database is working.
    
31.  Now you just need to log into your Cloudinary account and copy your API Emviroment Variable.
    
32.  Go back to the Django project then go to the env.py file.
    
33.  Then paste it in as a new environment variable. Make sure to remove the `Cloudinary_url=` part at the beginning of the value or else it won’t be valid.
    
34.  Then copy the same key and value to Heroku config vars
    
35.  Now add another config var DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC
    
36.  Then go back to the Django project on your code editor. Go to the settings.py file.
    
37.  Add the cloudinary libraries to settings.py
    
    ```bash
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        'django.contrib.admin',
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        'django.contrib.sessions',
        'django.contrib.messages',
        'django.contrib.staticfiles',
        'cloudinary',
         'news', #new goes here
    ]
    
    ```
    
38.  Now we just need to tell Django to use Cloudinary to store our media and static files.
    
39.  Go to the static files section that is near the end of the settings.py file. Then add in these links.
    
    ```python
    # Static files (CSS, JavaScript, Images)
    # <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/howto/static-files/>
    
    STATIC_URL = '/static/'
    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage'
    STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')]
    STATIC_ROOT = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')]
    
    MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
    
    ```
    
40.  Now you need to tell Django where the templates will be stored.
    
41.  Back to the top of settings.py file in the base directory section. Add the templates directory variable
    
    ```python
    # Build paths inside the project like this: BASE_DIR / 'subdir'.
    BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent
    TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')
    
    ```
    
42.  Then go to the middle section in settings.py you need to find the templates list and add TEMPLATES_DIR to the DIRS KEY in the dictionary.
    
    ```python
    TEMPLATES = [
        {
            'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
            'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR],
            'APP_DIRS': True,
            'OPTIONS': {
                'context_processors': [
                    'django.template.context_processors.debug',
                    'django.template.context_processors.request',
                    'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',
                    'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',
                ],
            },
        },
    ]
    
    ```
    
43.  Now go to the ALLOWED_HOSTS variable in the settings.py file and add the Heroku host name.
    
    ```python
    # SECURITY WARNING: don't run with debug turned on in production!
    DEBUG = True
    
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['<appname>.herokuapp.com']
    
    ```
    
44.  Now you to create 3 directories; media, static, templates in the root directory.
    
45.  Now we nee to crate a ‘Procfile’ that contains this text
    
    ```
    web: gunicorn <projectName>.wsgi
    
    ```
    
46.  Now you save all the files then use git to commit files to GitHub
    
    ```bash
    git add. 
    git commit -m "deployment commit"
    git push
    
    ```
    
47.  Then we deploy to heroku
    
48.  Open the terminal.
    
    ```bash
    command: heroku login -i
    
    ```
    
49.  Get your app name from heroku.
    
    ```bash
    heroku apps
    
    ```
    
50.  Set the heroku remote. (Replace <app_name> with your actual app name and remove the <> characters)
    
    ```bash
    heroku git:remote -a <app_name>
    
    ```
    
51.  Add and commit any changes to your code if applicable
    
    ```bash
    command: git add . && git commit -m "Deploy to Heroku via CLI"
    
    ```
    
52.  Push to both GitHub and Heroku
    
    ```bash
    git push origin main
    git push heroku main
    
    ```
### Production
1.  Go to the settings.py file and set DEBUG to True
    
    ```python
    DEBUG = TRUE
    
    ```
    
2.  Then below that add X_FRAME_OPTIONS = ‘SAMEORIGIN’
    
    ```python
    X_FRAME_OPTIONS = 'SAMEORIGIN'
    
    ```
    
3.  Then you save eve thing then commit then push to GitHub
    
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "commit message"
    git push
    
    ```
    
4.  Then head over to your Heroku app on the Heroku website.
    
5.  Go to settings reveal config vars then remove DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC variable
    
6.  Then deploy to Heroku
    
7.  Open the terminal.
    
    ```bash
    command: heroku login -i
    
    ```
    
8.  Get your app name from Heroku.
    
    ```bash
    heroku apps
    
    ```
