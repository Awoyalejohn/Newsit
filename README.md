## User Experience

I made user stories to plan and develop the functionality of the website. Each user story was separated into Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, and Won’t Have categories to help determine what was most important to focus on or leave out when building the website.

## Design
### Colour Scheme
The website colours used are black, white and blue colours that contrast well with each other. I verified this using Adobe color.
![Colour contrast image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Awoyalejohn/TD/main/static/images/color-contrast.png)

-   The navbar uses a white background with black text
-   The main website background used the blue colour
-   The card items are white and their contrast with blue makes for a satisfying look
-   Buttons are blue or black depending on their function. Blue usually edit buttons and black for everything else.
-   Footer is white
### Typography
The website uses Helvetica Neue as the main font-family and it is supplied by Bootstrap default.
### Wireframes
Wireframes were made with Figma to get a better idea on how things would look layout-wise on the website. The website is meant to look similar to Reddit, as it is a news posting website based on Reddit there are cards with post content inside them just like Reddit.
![wireframe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Awoyalejohn/TD/main/static/images/wireframe.png)
## Agile
The project features on GitHub was used to create a Kanban board that lists all of the user stories. Each user story has task that the user might be able to do on the website once the functionality has been added. All the must have user stories have been completed and the some of the user stories that are should have and could have will get implemented future when there is more time.
